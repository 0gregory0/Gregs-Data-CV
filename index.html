            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
              I am a university student motivated to solve societal problems
              with the power of technology. My core competencies include a
              strong work ethic, a great attention to detail and teamwork.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My eagerness and passion for learning has led me to be well
              conversant with Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, WordPress, Git and
              GitHub despite being a non-IT student.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Being a part of many tech communities such as GDSC (Google
              Developer Students' Club), MLSA P2P (Microsoft Learn Student
              Ambassador Peer to Peer mentorship) and PLP Africa (Power
              Learn Project) has developed in me a burning urge to make
              tech skills freely and readily available to other non-IT
              students like myself.

            <p>
              PLP Africa launched in Kenya with the goal of producing one
              million developers in Africa by 2027. I'm a member of the first
              cohort of 1,000 learners in Kenya. I am currently learning Python
              and Django, Dart and Flutter, Database Management Systems and Web
              Development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <h3>DIGITAL OPPORTUNITIES TRUST KENYA</h3>
            <p>
              On May of 2022, I enrolled for the cohort 3 of DOT Kenya and took virtual 
              classes on Web Development using WordPress. through DOT Kenya's program to 
              upskill the youth by providing them with digital skills required for 
              employment.

              <h3>SYCLE CITY</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
              As a university student, I struggle commuting to and fro university
              and moving between campuses. I felt that there has to be a better and
              convenient solution to this problem. So I decided to build Sycle City,
              a platform that facilitates bike sharing. I am working to make it a full
              working product.

            <h3>NUMBER GUESSING GAME</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
            A game where the computer picks a random integer between 1 and 100
            and the user has to guess what the number is. When the user
            guesses a number lower than the one the computer picked, the
            computer informs the user that the number is too low and the user
            has to guess again. When the user guesses a number higher than the
            one the computer picked, the computer informs the user that the
            number is too high and the user has to guess again. When the user
            guesses correctly, the user is told the guess is just right and
            the game terminates.
          </p>
          <br />
            <p>
              I'd like to implement a feature for awarding and tracking points.
              I'm also thinking of adding a 'Frenzy Multiplayer' feature which will
              support up to four players and the computer picks multiple random
              numbers in different rounds and the user(s) will try to guess
              them. Points are rewarded based on the accuracy of the guess and
              the user with the highest guess wins.

            </a>
            <p>
              I recreated the frontend of the PLP website getting inspiration
              from the official PLP website. I used HTML and CSS and this
              project helped me to improve on my design skills. (You can click

            <p>
              I like tech articles since they always teach me something new. I
              love them so much I decided to start my own Python Blog at
              hashnode. But hey! Why use hashnode when I can create my own blog
              website? And create I did... or I still am. I am creating a
              website where I document my web development learning journey. It
              currently only has one blog but I'd like to populate it with more
              articles once I learn more web technologies.

              This program takes the user's weight and height as input and
              calculates their BMI. When run, it returns one's BMI together with
              what it means. Precautions come with the program as it is not to
              be used for medical advice or diagnosis.

            <p>PLP Africa is non-profit organization that aims to empower
              one million youth with programming skills. I intern at PLP
              because their vision matches mine as I am also passionate
              about youth empowerment. My roles as an intern include
              helping instructors in their work, answering students'
              questions in the LMS and organizing live sessions with 
              the students to help them master the concepts they have been
              taught by the instructors.

            <p>Watoto Coding is non-profit organization that reaches out
              to the underpriviledged and underserved children of Kibera
              and promises them a better tomorrow by empowering them with
              tech skills such as programming with Scratch Jr, 3D
              Modelling with Tinkercad and automation with Arduino. I
              volunteer at Watoto Coding since I believe in it's mission to
              bridge the poverty gap. My roles as an volunteer include Social
              Media ambassadorship on Twitter and LinkedIn.
