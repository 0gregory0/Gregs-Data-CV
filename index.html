            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
              I am a university student motivated to solve societal problems
              with the power of technology. My core competencies include a
              strong work ethic, a great attention to detail and teamwork.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My eagerness and passion for learning has led me to be well
              conversant with Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, WordPress, Git and
              GitHub despite being a non-IT student.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Being a part of many tech communities such as MLSA P2P (Microsoft
              Learn Student Ambassador Peer to Peer mentorship) and PLP Africa
              (Power Learn Project) has developed in me a burning urge to make
              tech skills freely and readily available to other non-IT students
              like myself.

              I recreated the frontend of the PLP website getting inspiration

            </a>
            <p>
              I like tech articles since they always teach me something new. I
              love them so much I decided to start my own Python Blog at
              hashnode. But hey! Why use hashnode when I can create my own blog
              website? And create I did... or I still am. I am creating a
              website where I document my web development learning journey. It
              currently only has one blog but I'd like to populate it with more
              articles once I learn more web technologies.

              It currently runs on the Command Line Interface (CLI) / terminal

              <h3>NUMBER GUESSING GAME</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
              A game where the computer picks a random integer between 1 and 100
              and the user has to guess what the number is. When the user
              guesses a number lower than the one the computer picked, the
              computer informs the user that the number is too low and the user
              has to guess again. When the user guesses a number higher than the
              one the computer picked, the computer informs the user that the
              number is too high and the user has to guess again. When the user
              guesses correctly, the user is told the guess is just right and
              the game terminates.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The game currently runs on the terminal but I'm working on
              building the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Furthermore, I'm
              thinking of adding a 'Frenzy Multiplayer' feature which will
              support up to four players and the computer picks multiple random
              numbers in different rounds and the user(s) will try to guess
              them. Points are rewarded based on the accuracy of the guess and
              the user with the highest guess wins.

            </a>
            <p>
              This program takes the user's weight and height as input and
              calculates their BMI. When run, it returns one's BMI together with
              what it means. Precautions come with the program as it is not to
              be used for medical advice or diagnosis.
