            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
              I am a student motivated to solve societal problems with the power
              of technology. My core competencies include a strong work ethic, a
              great attention to detail and teamwork.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My passion for learning has led me to be well conversant with
              Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Dart, WordPress, Git and GitHub
              despite being a non-IT student.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Being a part of many tech communities such as MLSA P2P has
              developed in me a burning urge to make tech skills available to
              other non-IT students like myself.

            <p>
              I am working on a simple website that asks you questions based on
              your passions then recommends the field(s) in tech that would be a
              great match for you. Currently working on the Python code before
              moving to HTML and CSS.

            <ul>
              <li>addition</li>
              <li>subtraction</li>

            <p>
              It currently runs on the Command Line Interface (CLI) / terminal
              but I'm working on building the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

              <h3>NUMBER GUESSING GAME</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
              A game where the computer picks a random integer between 1 and 100
              and the user has to guess what the number is. When the user
              guesses a number lower than the one the computer picked, the
              computer informs the user that the number is too low and the user
              has to guess again. When the user guesses a number higher than the
              one the computer picked, the computer informs the user that the
              number is too high and the user has to guess again. When the user
              guesses correctly, the user is told the guess is just right and
              the game terminates.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The game currently runs on the terminal but I'm working on
              building the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Furthermore, I'm
              thinking of adding a 'Frenzy Multiplayer' feature which will
              support up to four players and the computer picks multiple random
              numbers in different rounds and the user(s) will try to guess
              them. Points are rewarded based on the accuracy of the guess and
              the user with the highest guess wins.
            </p>

              <h3>BMI CALCULATOR</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
              This program takes the user's weight and height as input and
              calculates their BMI. When run, it returns one's BMI together with
              what it means. Precautions come with the program as it is not to
              be used for medical advice or diagnosis.
